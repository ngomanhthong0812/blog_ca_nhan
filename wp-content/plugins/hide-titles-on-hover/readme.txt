Hide tooltip when hover on links or whatever elements having a title attribute. But still keep the accessibility.


== Description ==

Normally, when you go with your mouse over an element that has a title attribute, a tooltip will appear on the screen.

After activation Hide Titles On Hover  will replace all the titles attributes with aria-label. You will have no problems with the accessibility, but you will not see the native tooltip of the browser on hover.

No settings, just activate it and that's it.

== How to exclude Hide Titles On Hover on specific pages ==
This plugin has no options. But if you don't want to hide the tooltips on hover on specific pages, you can still do it by installing <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/freesoul-deactivate-plugins/">Freesoul Deactivate Plugins</a> to deactivate Hide Titles On Hover where you don't need it.

== PRO Version ==
The PRO version of this plugin is <a href="https://shop.josemortellaro.com/downloads/custom-title-tooltip/" target="_ctt">Custom Title Tooltip</a>.
